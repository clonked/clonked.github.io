<i>Last Sea Day baby, yeah!  Ahh, this day had so much going for it.  Sleep, sales and slews of cash and food to get, who wouldn't want to stay on the boat?</i><p>

It started off as any normal sea day.  Drag yourself out of bed at no earlier than eleven, trudge about, and feast on buffet.  But today was the last sea day, and normal buffet just wouldn't do.  Enter <i>Grand Buffet: Magnifico</i>, the epic, exhilarating buffet experience.  It's not only food, it's art!  Anything and everything could be found here.  It was like this: leave with an extra five pounds in your gut.  Sadly we have no pictures of this event, but definitely worthy of a picture.  Next time!<p>

Elsewhere on the ship major sales were happening.  Watches, cologne, clothes, all at slashed prices.  Activities like Word Puzzles and Family Feud were nestled in lounges throughout<br>the ship, but everyone was waiting for one special thing: <i>Bingo.</i><p>

1000 dollars.<br>
It had to go.<br>
Someone was going to get it.<br>
And for some reason five hundred or so other people though it would be them.  Not with this kid on the boat.  With a suave look on his face and a straw in the mouth, Nathan walked up to the bingo gal and ordered his ticket.  As she handed him his ticket, he thought "Maybe I should pick my own, for luck."  He dismissed this thought though and walked into the Carousel Lounge, stopping at the bar to order a Sprite.  Drink in one hand, card in the other, Nathan stood strong, surveying the enemy.<p>

"Like zombies, they are," he thought, his eyes narrowing.  "Mindlessly fumbling about, attempting to grasp hold what they ever so desire.  No, they won't be getting their cash today, cause there's a new cat in town."<p>

Nathan spotted his family and with a nod of acknowledgement to them, began walking toward them.  The rustle of lots of papers caught his ears and he stopped short.  Looking down he saw in the two seats in front of him, a couple with twelve cards total.  They frantically poured over them, organizing them so they could punch their numbers as quickly as possible.

Nathan's cheeks raised with a small smile.  "Not today," he said to himself and continued walking to his family where he sat himself down.  As he sat down he flung his loosely tied shoes from his feet, stretched out and five simple words came from his mouth:<p>

"I'm going to win today."<p>

Not a soul other than the boy himself believed it.  But he knew.  No, there was no way he would be taken down.  Not like that.<p>

The first four rounds passed slowly.  Small cash prizes were given to the cranky and decrepid.  "Let them have their peanuts," he said to himself, "The big one is mine."  Then began round five.  Silence filled the room.  It was war.  In jackpot blackout bingo, you don't take prisoners.<p>

It was a tense round.  Nathan's teeth cut into the straw in his mouth as he glared down at his card.  "Four numbers left.  Four isn't close.  I'm done for."  But then a thought, a ray of hope, entered the boy's mind.  "I'll check to make sure my numbers match the ones called."  Scanning the light-up bingo board for numbers that might have been called he could have missed, his heart skipped a beat.  I-16 was called, but not punched in.  "Three numbers left!  Ha!"<p>

G-46.  Two left.<br>
N-32.  One left.<br>
O-67.  BINGO!<p>

But not all was well, for bingo was achieved, but Nathan's lips had not moved.  Quickly and like a hawk Nathan's head darted around the room, searching for the one, the one that denied him.  Then he saw.  Brown hair, going gray.  Late sixties.  Woman.<p>

"She doesn't have it.  She made a mistake," Nathan told himself, though not sure whether to believe himself or not.  Then began the unbearable checking process.  Going through the card, row by row, number by number to confirm the bingo.  This one was taking a while.<p>

"No bingo," the checker announced.<p>

Sighs, applause, hoots and hollars echoed Nathan's mind.  There's still a chance.<p>

Then the bingo man spoke.  "When I turned off the machine I had two balls come up.  I will call them, then turn the machine on again to get more if no one has won."<p>

Nathan hoped.<br>
O-75.  The crowd was silent.<br>
N-30.  Still nothing.<p>

The announcer flipped on the machine and a ball shot up into his palm.  Flipping it so he could read the number, Nathan's heart pounded like a jackhammer on a steel rafter.<p>

O-65.<p>

<font size=+2>BINGO!</font><p>

Nathan's voice was deep and sure.  Heads turned.  Family's jaws dropped.  Nathan smiled an evil smile.  His arms rose into the air, and his hands pointed down.  The victory stance, it hadn't been done in years.  Raising to his bare feet, Nathan surveyed the crowd.  He smiled again, and shook his head with a half-chuckle.  With that he slowly walked forward, his mother not far behind.<p>

Then came the paranoia.  "I made a mistake, I know it.  I didn't really win, I had to screw up."  Handing his card to the checker, he walked up and stood next to the announcer, fumbling through his pockets for his straw.  He found it, and quickly put in his mouth and began nervously chewing.  The announcer was calling off the numbers when the checker looked up and smiled.<p>

Then he knew.<br>
He had achieved it.<p>

"We have a bingo."<p>

"Yeah!" He screamed and threw his straw, moving in a manner that can only be described as the 'I told you so, I showed you' gestures.  His money was handed to his mother (grr....) and the rest is history!<p>

Bingo ended and everyone dispersed.  Most ended up on the Sun Deck relaxing in the shade and planning future cruises.  Some kicked back in their rooms watching the excellent selection of movies available to them.  Nathan took this time to buy his mother a bottle of the Tommy Hilfiger Freedom for her fragrance.  He would present it to her that night at dinner.<p>

It was formal night, the last there would be, and everyone was dressed to the nines in time for cocktail hour.  The family had another group photo taken and then went to dinner.  Lobster.  Beef Wellington.  Heaven.  Everyone ate well, and Nathan had to unbutton his pants, or god knows what the full stomach of doom might have done.  It was then that the fragrance was presented.  Heidi loved it and the night ended on a happy note.<p>

<i>Boy, sea days sure are exciting, aren't they?  You never know what's going to happen.  And you're never going to know how the cruise ends unless you turn the page and read about our day in Athens.  Or you can live in the past and re-read our time in Egypt.</i><p>
