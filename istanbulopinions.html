<i>Everyone has an opinion or specific thing they liked the most about Istanbul.  In this case it was mostly things they liked or noticed that were different from life in the United States.  Nevertheless, it is interesting to see what each person picked out from the mass of choices there are.  Please note that Nathan's opinion has been exaggerated to fit the "I don't care" personality he wants people to think he has.</i><p>

I think my favorite thing about Istanbul had to be the ornate architecture and history of each building.  Every single building had such a background it was almost incomprehensible.  The prayer sounding from the Blue Mosque five times daily was a very different yet cool thing.

When I started my weekend in Istanbul, I never expected it to be as culturally sophisticated as it turned out to be.  There is such an expansive history to the town that so many people don't know.  The sultans were another thing.  The only image of them I had before was from Aladdin and the Arabian Nights.  It's good to finally see what's true and what isn't about these story characters.

<FONT color=#004040 face="Book Antiqua" size=2>Istanbul is almost as sleazy and dirty of a town as its inhabitants.  The only interesting things in the town are the hotel we stayed at and the cistern.  It was also fun the morning we were allowed to stay in the hotel room, which I would have happily spent all weekend in.

After spending the weekend in Istanbul, I have to say I didn't like it too much.  The city's quality was downright poor, it was dirty and homeless animals and people run all around.  The people were friendly though - except for the salesmen and homeless who were always out to get a cheap buck.

I really hated how the sales people always followed us around, it was so different from at home.  The Blue Mosque was really neat and really big.  It was also very sad that all the kitties there don't have a good home and have to live on the streets.

The entire weekend in Istanbul I felt as if I was in a movie.  Everything was so different culturally, and that made it very interesting to see how they lived versus us.  The rug salesmen that wouldn't give up on getting you to come to their store were both annoying and ridiculous.

I was very impressed with the friendliness of the people, moreso than I expected to be.  The prayer sessions five times a day were fascinating, and I was mesmerized by the men washing their feet in and around the temples before they entered.  The Grand Bazaar's immense size was bewildering to me as well.

<FONT color=#004040 face="Book Antiqua" size=2>Istanbul was much more exotic and sofisticated than I thought it would be.  It was basically a modern city with not so modern people living in it, and that was interesting to learn about.  The Topkapi Palace was very cool.

Istanbul is a very exotic city.  It is definitely an 'East meets West' scenario in that the city is modern - it even has a tram system - but the people aren't.  I really loved learning about the Hagia Sophia and the other Muslim buildings we visited.

I'm really going to remember this first experience with the Muslim religion.  I totally enjoyed learning about the religion itself, it's a lot more down to earth than I thought it was going to be.  The colors and textures of the city were amazing, it was like a kaleidoscope.
