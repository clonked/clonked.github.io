<i>It had to come.  The last day of the cruise was upon us.  And there wasn't a more fitting way to usher it out than with the leisurely tour of Athens we had that day.</i><p>

Our tour began at eight forty-five a.m. and the usual routine was followed to a tee.  We piled into the bus and sat back for our driving tour of the city, which was eventually going to dump us off at the Acropolis.<p>

Sure enough the bus plopped us at the bottom of the Acropolis.  Everything we were about to see is two thousand five hundred years old and built during the golden age of Greece, the beginning of Western philosophy, science, culture and art.  We hiked up through a 150 feet wide columned entrance, The Propylea, admiring the Temple of Athena Nike or Wingless Victory along the way.  Much of the area was under restoration while we were there, but it was nonetheless beautiful.

</td>

We finally reached the top and were given an awesome view.  The plataeu that the Parthenon rests on is huge.  The Parthenon, built between 447 and 437 BC, was dedicated to Athena, the patron goddess of the city.  There are many observation points and smaller temples speckling the Acropolis.  The Erechtheion, a temple honoring both Athena and Poseidon sits beside the Parthenon.  On it is the Porch of the Karyatids with sculptures of maidens as columns supporting the roof.   We walked all about, looking at the carvings in the rocks plus I had some fun with my brothers, throwing pebbles at one another, and in some cases, shoving them down shirt and pants.<p>

Athens is a busy, modern city with over four million inhabitants.  It is quite a contrast to the buildings and ruins of ancient Athens.<p>

We also went to a gift shop, which sold mostly fake statues and statuettes of well-known Greek monuments or sculptures.  We didn't spend long there, and continued on our driving tour.<p>

Of particular interest during our city tour was the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior.  At each corner of the building was a Royal Guard obviously in royal uniform.  All in all, pretty normal, except for the cheerleader shoes.<p>

</font></center>
</td>

</table>

We drove by this arch at the end of our three hour tour.  The fact that it has remained standing there all these years is an impressive sight<br>to behold.<p>

Jan, John and Shelley stayed in Athens for lunch and visited The Plaka, the 19th century shopping district at the foot of the Acropolis.  The rest of us returned to the ship in time to catch the end of the lunch buffet, and spent the rest of the afternoon relaxing, except for when we had to face reality and pack our bags for the impending doom, the return to reality, the end of the cruise.  We met at seven for the last cocktail hour, and went to dinner thereafter.  Some watched the movie <i>You've Got Mail</i>, which was showing on TV, but otherwise it was an early night for everyone.<p>

<i>There you have it, the end of a legacy.  You can turn to the last page and read the conclusion, or you can go back into the fairy tale and read about the bingo day again.  I'd recommend the second of the two.</i><p>
