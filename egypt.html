<i>Egypt, land of mystery and intrigue.  And we got to spend two days there!  Our tour had everything: an annoying guide, the pyramids, a five star hotel, and buffet meals.  Most of the group probably consider these two days to be the best of the cruise (others choose the two sea days).</i><p>

Once again, the tour started bright and early at eight a.m.  However, unlike normal, we wouldn't be returning to the ship that evening.  We were going to spend the night in Cairo,<br>Egypt's capital and the largest city in Africa.  So everyone said their goodbyes to the ship and headed across this snake-like connection of floats to reach dry land, where we boarded the bus.  We met our Egyptologist guide and teacher for the next<br>two days, Bassam, then laid back for the three hour plus drive<br>we needed to put behind us.<p>

When we got into Cairo the first thing we did was go to the Egyptian Antiquities Museum.  The Museum is an archive of thousands upon thousands of Egyptian treasures recovered from tombs or dug out of the desert.  We regret not being able to offer you more pictures than the one of Tutankhamun's funerary mask, as the digital camera was being used to film Bassam.  We spent most of our time taking in the Tutankhamun collection, seeing the amazing things Howard Carter found in the 1920's when he rediscovered Tut's tomb in the Valley of the Kings.  It's hard to put into words the feeling of looking at things so beautifully and intricately made over three thousand years ago and hidden for that long.<p>

After visiting the museum we headed to the hotel where we were to have lunch.  Lunch was quite impressive.  We had a buffet to choose from and an entire indoor Nile-view dining room, which offered wonderful scenery.<p>

Following lunch we went to the Muhammad Ali Mosque which was very similar on the inside to the Blue Mosque.  Bassam taught us about the Muslim religion and about the upcoming holy month of Ramadan.  Following the mosque we went to the Turkish Bazaar.  It was built in 1382 during the Ottoman period and is like a maze of tiny shops selling jewelry, carpets, perfume oils, spices and such.  It was quite busy as many people were in the streets waiting for the announcement of the beginning of Ramadan.  From here we went to our hotel, the Semiramis, to clean up and drop off our bags in preparation for our evening

in the desert at the Sound and Light Show projected on the Sphinx and Pyramids of Giza.  The word from the adults about this experience was, "Utterly amazing", "I can't believe I'm seeing the pyramids!", "I'm <i>really</i> at the pyramids" and "I got such goosebumps and tears in my eyes when I realized what was sitting in front of me!"  The laser show itself was quite interesting.  Starting after dark and using the pyramids, images were projected onto the pyramids and sphinx which made them look cool and teach you about them.  For example they used the lasers to show the path of the tunnels in the pyramids.  Following the show everyone returned to the hotel and slept up for the upcoming big day.<p>

The following morning we ate breakfast with a twist.  It was on a mini-cruiseboat traveling the Nile!  Though we were not able to get a window table, the views we saw were nonetheless quite cool.  After the breakfast cruise we drove to the Sakkara step pyramid.  It was a very interesting location, and actually is the first attempt at constructing

a pyramid.  It was built over 4,000 years ago for King Zoser by the architect Imhotep.  The step pyramid is part of the largest necropolis, or burial ground, in Egypt.  Originally, the entire complex was surrounded by a colonnaded wall, only part of which remains today.  We entered the complex through the Hypostyle Hall, a corridor with 42 pillars.  There was one drawback to the locale, the annoying donkey photo-men.  They would attempt to get you on the donkey (even without your consent) and then get a group member to take pictures.  If you took a picture they would continually follow you, asking for <i>baksheesh</i> - money - until you gave them some.  At the first sign of the Tourist Police, however, they'd run like the wind.<p>

After the step pyramid we headed to lunch at a different hotel, but just as good.  It looked to be prepared for a formal party rather than a sweaty tour group, but hey, don't look a gift horse in the mouth.  The hotel also had shopping areas and enough to keep you busy for a long time.  We only stayed an hour.  But no matter, because our next stop was the Pyramids of Giza and the Sphinx - this time, in daylight.<p>

The group was allowed to enter one pyramid, the third built and smallest, that of the pharaoh Mycerinus.  The tunnel was very small.  You had to crouch to go down a steep ramp.  When first entering, the air was quite humid and stifling created by the exhaled breath of visitors.  As we decended, the air became surprisingly cool.  The long, narrow corridor opened into a large, high ceiling room - the burial chamber.  It was quite an an amazing experience.<p>

Following the pyramids was our close-up look at the Sphinx.  This was an unparalleled moment in time - standing next to the Sphinx with the Great Pyramid of Cheops, the only remaining Wonder of the Ancient World, looming in the background beside it.  We're talkin' 5,000 year old stuff here!  Amazing!!<p>
Once again we apologize for the lack of photos of these locations, but the digital camera was often being put to other uses.<p>

After touring the Giza Plateau everyone went back to the buses for our journey through the desert to Alexandria, where the cruise ship was waiting to pick us up.  We got back and took the remainder of the evening easy talking about our experiences thus far and, for the adults, almost in disbelief of where we had been and what we had seen.<p>

<i>And that's Egypt in a nutshell.  You can now either go forward to the sea day or go back and re-read Ashdod information.</i><p>
