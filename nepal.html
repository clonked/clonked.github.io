<font size=2>Welcome to my online photo gallery of my trip to Nepal.  For the ten-day trek I traveled throughout India and Nepal, seeing and experiencing many interesting things.  My trip was divided roughly into two segments, the mountain trek and the site-seeing within many different cities.  Both were quite different from one another and it is difficult to believe that they were even of the same country.<p>

Now that I look back at things, most of the time we spent on the trek throughout the Nepalese mountains was actually just relaxing at our camps.  We would hike four to six hours a day, usually shoving off between eight or nine and then hiked til two; with a lunch break of course.  It sure didn't seem like that however.<p>

I would go through at least three 1.5 liter bottles of water a day and not pottee a bit of it out.  It all came out however, as sweat.  With the sun beating down on my brow and my sweat entirely soaking my shirt I felt as if I was a pack animal; blindly hiking up the mountain to some unforseen goal.  Though I was out of breath, I eventually came to ingore the heavy breathing and only had to stop moving when my legs began to feel that they could no longer carry me - it was as if they would turn rubber - and that was quite often.<p>

When the hike was over I would have to change out of the clothes I was wearing or else I would get so cold, the sweat would drop my body temperature as it cooled.  Nearly everyday I was able to shower in a nearby hotel, so I was always refreshed and ready for dinner, which was usually around six.  Dinner itself was milding spicy and composed entirely of vegetarian food, except for the last day when lots of chicken was available.  I ate three plates full.<p>

When the trek came to a close we returned to Pokhara and for the remaining five days mainly saw temple after temple, which got quite boring.  One day however, we aided in the painting of the Maiti building, an organization designed to help women in need.  Since the temple-seeing got so repetitious, I was so enthused the last day - when we saw the Taj Mahal - for it meant I was returning home.<p>

I endured a good fifteen hours of travel, but in the end I finally returned to my house.  My knees still hurt terribly when I walk down stairs, and I get rubbery legs when walking up stairs.  I'm definately too old for such trips.  But it all matters not, for this is where I spend most of my time.<p>

For a more complete listing of what we did day-to-day of the entire trip, I had the itinerary scanned and converted to text which is available in several formats.  You can choose from either Microsoft Word (compatible with Word 95 or greater) or just plain text.  All the pictures of Nepal on this site have been put up for download as well.<p>

Both the itinerary and pictures are zipped for a quick download.  If you are a user of Windows 98 or use Winzip you can open this file with no problem.  If you don't have Winzip, it can be downloaded <a href="http://www.winzip.com">here</a>.<p>Click the respective icon to commense download.<p>

The following is a collection of pictures mom and dad think to be good indicators of what I saw and did on the trip.  The red text on the photos was added by mom.  *sigh*  I've done my best to put them in chronological order, so without further ado, here's the Comprehensive Visual Guide to Nepal!<br><br>
