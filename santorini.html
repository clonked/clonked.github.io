<i>Santorini, the island city known for its trademark white and blue buildings.  But flashy structures aren't the only attraction to this island.  The ancient city at Akrotiri which was covered in ash until the late sixties holds even the most stalwart of archeologists in awe.</i><p>

Once again the group was subject to the rigors of the early morning tours; when your tender drives off at eight thirty a.m., you don't exactly get to sleep in.  Following the usual routine, we all prepared ourselves for the day and met for breakfast, buffet style on the Sun Deck.  Following the stuffing of our stomachs with hash and meats we rolled our way down to the launch point and got into our tender, ready for the relaxing day<br>in Santorini.<p>

The tender ride was a soothing ride, an excellent beginning to the day.  This tour, for a change, wasn't about hopping from site to site in a rush-rush manner.  We were just going to visit ancient Akrotiri and end the day browsing and buying, from the town shops.

The tender ride provided great views for all, particularly of the ship.  This was the first time we got to see it in such a way, and it certainly was an impressive site to see.  When the tender pulled into the dock we were ushered out of it and into our waiting bus which would climb the mountain for us.  Running in the streets around us were groups of dogs, checking things out.  Quickly getting away from them and into our bus, we started making way to our first stop, Akrotiri.<p>

The ride up the mountain was entertaining, giving us great views of the ocean and land surrounding us.  As became evident to us, we weren't the only people touring the island that day.  When the bus got further inland, we were able to see the almost endless fields of grape vines that grew in their respective season.  It seemed wherever there was flat ground, a vine was planted there.<p>

The ruins of an ancient Bronze-age town of some 30,000 inhabitants were discovered at Akrotiri and some believe them to be the lost continent of Atlantis, although no written records have ever surfaced to support this.  The volcano of Santorini exploded in 1450 B.C. causing the middle of the island to sink while covering the land that remained with a blanket of ash and pumice 160 feet deep.  A tidal wave swept across the Aegean and engulfed Crete, some 70 miles away.<p>

When the bus arrived at Akrotiri we were met by a gentleman who told us there was no picture taking of the ruins.  Those highly educated island men were worried that the rocks that survived thousands of years and a volcano explosion might turn to dust if we photographed them too much.  Of course we respected the kind man's wishes and went along on the tour.<p>

The ruins themselves were enclosed in a giant warehouse-like structure and were in various stages of excavation.  The ancient remains of these buildings stand two and three stories high, some with traces of balconies on the street fronts.  Pottery found here is of the same style as that of Minoan Crete which has led archeologists to believe that both civilizations were extinguished by the same natural disaster.  We traveled through the dig in a U-turn like fashion; going to the far back of the building and then making a sharp turn to continue along the side and eventually exit.<p>

Leaving the dig site of Akrotiri we began our rather engaging drive of the island.  We saw more grape vines and stopped at sites which offered good views of the horizon.  Interestingly enough,

our ship was visible from nearly each and every one of these photo stops - as seen to the right - where we, for a split second, saw our ship through the opening in the ravine.  This was also seen at the restaurant we pit stopped at, and Fira could be seen in the distance.  That was where we would end the day.<p>

Our drive came to a close and dropped us off in Fira to look around and return to the ship at our leisure.  We elected to have a peek in the many jewelry, perfume and trinket shops that were nestled in the streets.  Everyone found something they liked.  Jewelry for the Omaha crowd, and a globe made of semi-precious stones for the Anderson's.  All this shopping left everyone flat out dead, so we took a break in a cafe that offered the great views seen to the right.  When the coffee cups ran dry, we continued traveling the narrow cobblestone pedestrian-only streets and Nathan found a Hilfiger Athletics fragrance package he <i>absolutely</i> had to have.  All this excitement left the fam hungry for some Greek dining.  We found a quaint restuarant on the main street, and we quickly discovered their special was lamb, lamb, and more lamb.  They especially loved to serve it with runny spinach in a soup bowl.  Their shrimp was also served with the heads intact, letting all the innards ooze from them when broken open.  But what are ya gonna do?<p>

After lunch we split up into two groups, one continued to explore the windy, cobblestone streets while the second went back to the ship via a scenic cable car ride.  The group that remained saw more shops, more jewelry and more views.  Eventually though, everyone made their way back to the ship and enjoyed the rest of the day relaxing before the semiformal dinner that evening.<p>

<i>Now that you're finished reading about Santorini, you can either trudge forward to read about our day in Rhodes, or backstep a bit and re-read the ancient coin caper experience Tim had.</i><P>
