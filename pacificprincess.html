As can be seen from the picture and data table above, the Pacific Princess is an amazing ship in both size and splendor.  We will now look at the Pacific's interior,  specifically areas of interest such as the Observation Decks and the Casino.  We shall start from the bottom of the ship (<i>Coral</i> Deck Three) and work our way up to <i>Sun</i> Deck Nine.<p>

 The Dining Room and the Medical Center.  The Coral Dining Room is the only location in which dinner is served every night, and required dress level can vary from casual to formal, which would be suit and tie or evening dress.  Not only dinner is served in the Coral Dining Room.  You can go there for breakfast or lunch if your heart so desires.  The Medical Center is open twenty-four hours a day and you can head on over there whether you have a sore throat or a broken leg!<p>

Moving up one floor to the <i>Fiesta</i> Deck, we find the Purser's Desk and a rather extravagant staircase and wall display.  The Purser's Desk is basically onboard public relations, if you have a problem, question or complaint, head on over to the Purser and they'll handle it for you.  The staircase is one of two locations which you may have your photograph taken on formal nights, and also takes us up to <i>Aloha</i> Deck Five.<p>

Aside from being the floor that our staterooms are located on, the <i>Aloha</i> Deck has a large selection of places to check out.  For starters the Photo Shop is located here, in which you may purchase any photographs Princess photographers may have taken of you during the trip.  Also housed on this desk is the Beauty Salon and the Tour Office.  If you want a manicure or your hair done up, stop at the Beauty Salon.  They cover all the bases.<p>

A quick hop up to <i>Riviera</i> Deck Six will field ever more wonderful places to visit.  Resting at the front of this deck is the Carousel Lounge, which hosts a motley of activities.  The daily bingo games are held here, which are an experience not easily forgotten.  Prize money ranges from fifty to hundreds, maybe even <i>thousands</i> of dollars per game.  Needless to say, this draws many people to the games every day.  Also in the Carousel after

dinner, there are usually nightly stage productions for your enjoyment.  Just outside the Carousel is the Crown Casino, a nice-sized casino that, age willing, should certainly be a place to spend some time, and money.  Games range from Slots to Craps so any gambler should feel at home here.  Just to the left of the Casino is the Movie Theater, which shows two different movies daily.  All the movies played have been in the theaters very recently.  To the left of the Theater is the Bridge Lounge, which takes on several rolls.  Not only is it a board game room, but in times of emergency it is our Muster Station, which is a place of safety to gather.  The <i>Riviera</i> deck's impressive lineup isn't finished yet.  Clear down at the back of the ship we have the Gym, Pacific Lounge, Pirate's Cove Bar and Disco, and the Princess Boutique, an onboard shop.  The Gym is just what it sounds to be, a fully equipped fitness center with Nordic Tracks, weight lifting and more.  The Pacific Lounge is yet another of the many lounges you can go to relax in.  If you're in the mood for dancing, head to the Pirate's Cove.  And last but not least, is the Princess Boutique, which sells everything from cologne to batteries.<p>

Moving on up to the <i>Promenade</i> Deck Seven we find mostly staterooms, but clear at the back you can access the Library and Terrace Room.  On <i>Bridge</i> Deck Eight we unsurprisingly find the Bridge and the Senior Officer's Quarters, along with passenger staterooms.  On this deck, however, there is an outside deck with lounge chairs that makes for a nice, relaxing spot in the warm Mediterranean sun.<p>

After two decks of nothing much, <i>Sun</i> Deck Nine is sure to please.  Right at the very front is the Starlight Lounge, a bar that looks out onto the water.  Because of its ideal looks and location, this bar became the location for our nightly cocktail hour at seven p.m.  During the day, however, the Starlight can be found hosting a wide variety of activities, from group quizzes to Origami box making to team Outburst games.

Exiting the Starlight Lounge will bring you to a glass-roofed eating area complete with a swimming pool and lounge chairs.  There is a full-fledged buffet here that is open for breakfast, lunch and even a midnight snack.  The buffet's contents changes daily and even some days there are themed meals, such as the International Buffet in which foods from many different countries were served.  The pool is adorned with bluegreen tiling and in the center rests the golden Princess statue.  Traveling up any of three sets of stairs will take you to the observation platforms.  From here you can get an excellent view of the ship docking or pulling out of harbor.  Also on this level is a balcony that overlooks the pool and buffet on the <i>Sun</i> Deck.  Of course the Observation Deck is stocked full of padded lounge chairs that invite you to spend the afternoon relaxing whilst admiring the view.<p>
