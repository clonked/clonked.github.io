We depart from Basel at 19:20 for London and then connect for our 21:15 flight on British Airways to the capital of India, New Delhi.
<p>
<b><font color="#ff0000">October 03:</font></b><p>
Arrive in New Delhi at 12:20pm and connect with our flight to Kathmandu. Upon arrival and clearing Customs, we immediately transfer to our hotel with time for freshen up before dinner in the garden of the hotel. After our meal we have an orientation meeting where we go over some logistical points such as trekking permits, etc., before a well deserved good night's sleep.

Up early and transfer to the domestic airport for our 40 minute flight to Pokhara. We start this trek by taking a jeep from Pokhara to the base of the final foothills facing the Annapurnas. After arriving at the small village of Phedi (3,300ft), we'll climb for about two hours on a spiraling slate-covered stairway up to the small village of Dhampus (6,350 ft) which is a scattered series of farms and tea shops along the ridge line. The views from Dhampus are a terrific first impression of the trek as the towering peaks of Machapuchare (Fishtail) and the Annapurna and Lamjung ranges loom above us only a few kilometers away. We'll have lunch in a thick forest above Dhampus in full view of the peaks.
<p>
After lunch, the trail climbs through lush rhododendron forests to the crest which separates Pokhara valley from the Modi Khola River valley. We'll take a break on the pass (5,500ft) before descending to the thickly forested jungle which covers the valley slopes. The trail descends sharply until it levels out and passes through a series of small villages before finally arriving at our first campsite at the village of Landrung (5,400ft). The views of the gigantic Annapurna South snow-covered Himalayan wall at the end of the valley are spectacular from the camp.
<p>

Today's trek descends steeply through the farms of Landrung down to the Modi Khola River and then crosses over a suspension bridge to the opposite bank (4,400ft). From there you'll climb over 2,000 feet up a winding "stairway" which leads to our next camp at Ghandrung. This village is the headquarters of the newly established Annapurna National Park and offers some of the best views anywhere in Nepal. Not only does one see the Annapurnas, but now the exquisite Machapuchare comes into view with it's Distinct "Fishtail" peak. The spectacular sunsets on this magnificent Himalayan wall are unforgettable.

<p>

Climbing steeply from Ghandrung, today's trek leads first through terraced fields, past Nepali farmhouses, into a dense forest. This is a particularly good day for the bird-watchers and those interested in flowers. In the spring, the rhododendrons and orchids are in full bloom. After an hour of trekking, the trail splits - one leading to Annapurna Basecamp heads off to the right and our trail continues through the forest until reaching a narrow canyon. The trail then begins a steep ascent up a river gorge until it crests at a small pass at an altitude of 8,100ft where we'll have lunch. The trek then heads into some of the most beautiful and enchanted forest imaginable. Moss-covered trees and natural old growth provide a sanctuary for a multitude of birds and monkeys and the kilometer of trail is truly a wonderful walk. Exiting the forest, one comes upon a spectacular vantage-point in thick rhododendron forest where views of the entire Annapurna range awaits. We'll camp near a small village calledTadapani at an altitude of 8,700ft.
<p>
<b><font color="#ff0000">October 07:</font></b><p>
Leaving Tadapani though the rhododendron forest, the train first descends for about 1,000ft before regaining the altitude and crests a ridge line at a cluster of huts called Banthanti (8,600ft). The trail then levels out for about 30 minutes before reaching a small riverside village (8,400ft). We then beginning the steep ascent to Deurali Pass. The climb takes about an hour of steady uphill climbing before cresting the pass at an altitude of l0,000ft. There is a look-out tower above the small village where we'll have lunch which offers a 360 degree Himalayan panorama. After lunch we'll trek for about 2 hours through thick forests until we reach the small cluster of tea shops and houses at the base of Pun Hill. The village of Ghorapani (9,100ft) has wonderful views of Dhaulagiri, but more importantly, it serves as a "base camp" for day hikes up to the summit of Pun Hill (10,200ft) which offer some of the very best views in all of Nepal. If we reach Ghorapani in time, we'll hike up for a sunset view.
<p>

The classic way to experience the fantastic Himalayan panorama from Pun Hill is to hike up in the early morning hours just before dawn. When you crest the top of the 1,000 foot climb, the views are truly unforgettable. The crimson light of dawn paint the seemingly endless chain of snow-capped peaks a beautiful shade of pink while the terraced farmlands below the Himalayas provide a breathtaking foreground. Mounts Annapuma, Dhaulagiri, Tulche, Machapuchare and countless other massive snow-capped peaks stretch to the horizon in both directions.  The few hours we spend on Pun Hill with be one of the highlights of the trek. Around 9:00, we'll head back down to Ghorapani and have our breakfast.
<p>
The day's trek will rejoin the trail that leads north to Tibet and gradually descends until reaching a small bridge at 8,100 feet. As you trek, you'll constantly meet mule trains laden with cargo. The traders are Tibetan as well as from the Mustang region of Nepal who still use the trail for their tradition of trading with the villages in the Northern regions of Nepal near the Tibetan border. Continuing on the gradual descent we'll then come to the village of Bantanti (7,100ft). The trail then descends sharply over a steep trail through the village of Ulleri and on down to the river. After crossing the river, we'll come to our lunch stop at the small village of Tirkedhunga (4,800ft).
<p>
After lunch, the trail continues the easy descent through a series of village until reaching the confluence of the rivers at the settlement of Birathanti. From there it's a short walk out to the newly constructed road which leads back to Pokhara. We then meet our coach for the short drive to the Pohkara where we check in to our hotel and have those long awaited showers.

Upon finishing breakfast we begin our exploration of this fascinating, ancient city of Kathmandu. Swambunath, also known as the Monkey Temple, will be one of our visits as well. We'll explore the ancient city center of Durbar Square where not only the most historically significant temples and shrines of this timeless culture are located, but also the main marketplace.
<p>
We will then drive to the site where the gigantic 2,000 year old Buddhist Stupa of Bodhanath is located and take the opportunity to explore this sacred pilgrimage destination of Himalayan Buddhists. You'll have lunch in a restaurant in Bodhanath that overlooks the Stupa and the many impressive monasteries that have been built around the sacred area. We'll then visit the ancient city of Patan which was once a separate kingdom in the Kathmandu Valley's long history.

Located on the banks of the Bagmati River Pashupatinath welcomes pilgrims from all over the Indian sub-continent who come to pay homage to this most precious of Shiva temples. We then head to the airport for our flight to New Delhi.
