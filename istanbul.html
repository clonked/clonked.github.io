<i>The Istanbul portion of the trip was basically the tip of the iceberg to the twelve-day Holy Land cruise.  We spent two and a half days in the city taking in local sites and sounds, not to mention foods of all kinds.  Now, for a little background info on this unusual city with its long and colorful past. <p>
Istanbul is the only city located on two continents.  It has dominated the Bosphorus Strait for more than two thousand five hundred years.  Known as Constantinople, the sixth-century capital of Rome's Eastern Empire boasted proverbial wealth.  The capital cities of Europe were mere villages in comparison.  Constantinople was the most heavily fortified city in the Byzantine world.  When the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire found the inner harbor blocked by a heavy chain, he used thousands of his soldiers to drag seventy ships on wheels and cradles over the narrow, steep neck of land that separated the Golden Horn from the sea.  In so doing, the Sultan's fleet attacked from the rear, ending the rule of the Christian faith that had lasted one thousand one hundred years.</i><p>

We arrived in Istanbul at approximately two thirty p.m. (Turkey's time) via a three hour plane ride from Paris, France.  Our baggage was collected in quite short time and we<br>proceeded to the van that would take us to our hotel, the<br><i>Blue House</i>.  The Blue House is a very nice hotel located near many of the temples, shops and mosques we plan to visit.  Our party was situated on the fourth floor and I (along with my family) was fortunate enough to get the suite.  The suite itself was three rooms, a bedroom, a sitting room and a bathroom.  The sitting room had a sofa that turned into a bed, which I slept on.  To the right are pictures of the suite.  <p>

Once everyone unpacked and got settled in, we went to the terrace top on the hotel which during the summer season is a restaurant.  It being winter, of course, made it closed.  We still got the same great view the restaurant patrons of the warmer season would though.  The Hagia Sophia and the Blue Mosque were visible from there.  <p>

Around five p.m. the group left the hotel to go to the Grand Bazaar, a giant indoor market housing <i>four thousand</i> different shops selling anything from jewelry to handmade rugs.  We had to walk a long distance to reach the bazaar, and a lot of the group got their first sampling of the street beggars and hagglers that just don't leave you alone.  Upon arrival, however, the bazaar was a sight worth the beggar's pleas for pocket change.  Hall after hall full of seemingly endless amounts of shops; one could spend hours here.  The younger group members didn't last that long, however, and soon wanted to return to the hotel.  So we split in two with the Bievers and Jan remaining at the bazaar while the remainder of the party returned to the hotel.  On the walk back, we got a chance to sample a local chicken kebab sandwich, which everyone agreed was quite a great treat.<p>

When our hotel was about a block away from us, Turkish singing suddenly filled the air around us.  Every day, five times a day at prayer time this singing occurs.  It has something to do with the prayer ritual.  It was coming from loud speakers placed on the Blue Mosque and other nearby objects.  The mosque was not only adorned with loud speakers, but floodlights as well to show off its beauty even after nightfall.<p>

When the Bievers and Jan returned from the bazaar, we gathered for dinner in the hotel's dining room.  Dinner consisted of many Turkish dishes that included fish of the day, shish kebabs and pastas.  The meal lasted a good hour and a half after which everyone left the table satisfied but tired.  Goodnights were exchanged and the party broke into groups to retire for the evening.<p>

<a name="day two"><img src="gfx/day-2.jpg" border=0></a><br>

Wakeup came from the adults at about nine a.m. for me, and after showering and cleaning myself up, I went down to breakfast to join the group.  As it turned out, most people had already almost completely finished eating and were beginning to plan the day's activities.  My brothers and myself returned to the room to relax while these choices were made.  Half an hour later the adults came to us stating that we would now visit the Blue Mosque.<p>

The Blue Mosque has been a familiar landmark of the Istanbul skyline, topped with a huge dome and six graceful minarets, since the seventeenth century.  We walked the block from our hotel to the mosque and looked about the exterior gardens for a bit.  Avoiding beggars and salespeople we eventually made it into the walls of the mosque.  The women in our party took out shawls in preparation to cover their heads upon entering.  Before we did that, however, we looked about the courtyards and outside of the building.  Finally when entering, we had to take off our shoes so as not to harm the carpet inside, and the women proceeded to cover their heads. When inside we saw the reason it is named the <i>Blue</i> Mosque.  The tiles that decorate the inside are by majority blue and there are more than twenty thousand of them.  We looked about and took pictures but prayer time was getting close, so we needed to leave.  We exited the grounds and walked out into a park-like area which is what remains of the Hippodrome.<p>

The Hippodrome was once a huge stadium.  Here a quarter of a million spectators cheered on their favorite charioteers as they raced four-horse teams around the track, like in the movie <i>Ben Hur</i>.  In the center of this open area is a large Egyptian obelisk taken from the Temple of Karnak in Luxor,  probably very similar to the ones that will soon come in Egypt.  The obelisk is only a third of its original height and rests on a stone base with carvings in it depicting the Crusades.  It was given to the city of Istanbul as a gift to show good faith between the two peoples.

After leaving the obelisk we began to head for the Hagia Sophia.  Shortly after we started walking we noticed that a mangey old

mutt that had been lying by the obelisk was now following us!  It would periodically stop to itch itself, but it would scurry right back up to us in a second.  The dog obviously had a horrible flea problem.  Everyone tried to ignore it but it kept on following.<p>

The dog aside, we continued walking and eventually came to a boy selling donut-looking bread covered in sesame seeds.  What made this salesboy so interesting, though, was the fact that he balanced all the bread on a board that rested upon his head!  On the advice of a fellow American we had bumped into, several members of the group purchased the interesting bread, and got to pluck the piece of their choice from the boy's head.  Everyone agreed it was a very tasty treat and our walk to the Hagia Sophia resumed.  The dog had remained with us for the bread buying and would have been with us until we reached the Hagia Sophia if Shelley hadn't stepped on the itchy creature.  It yelped in pain and wearily trod away from us.<p>

We finally arrived at the Hagia Sophia, and hired a guide to show us the ropes of the temple.  Built in 532 A.D. by Justinian when Istanbul was known as Constantinople, it is an example of Byzantine architecture.  It turns out that the Sophia we were inside was the second rebuilding of the original, the previous two had burned down.  In fact the one we were in was still under renovation.  The golden box seen in the middle background of the picture is the Sultan's prayer box, raised from the ground to prevent assassinations.<p>

The Hagia Sophia is one of the three largest churches in the world.  Its interior is elaborately decorated with marble, mosaics and even pillars from ancient Ephesus.  It was the most important Christian church until the contruction of St. Peters Basilica in Rome one thousand years later.<p>

By the time our guide completed the tour of the Hagia Sophia the tummies of our party were beginning to rumble.  The ear-shattering shrieks of the younger children worsened the situation.  We decided to walk the road that we went the previous night to the Grand Bazaar; there were many restaurants to choose from along the sidewalk.  Our choice ended up being the first restaurant we came to, the Pudding Shop.  Ironically it is a full-fledged restaurant serving many Turkish dishes.  The food was very good, no matter what you picked.  When everyone had their fill, we prepared to go see the afternoon sights.<p>

Just under a block from the Pudding Shop was our next stop, the Byzantine Cistern.  The cistern is an underground water storage designed in the sixth-century to supply the city with water.  At one point when Istanbul was conquered, the knowledge of the location to the cistern was lost - for hundreds of years.  It was only rediscovered recently because the fact became known that people were drawing water and fish from holes in their basements.  It has since been restored over a long period of twelve years to allow visitors to tour this amazing water storage facility.  An interesting sidenote about the cistern is that is was used in the James Bond movie <i>From Russia With Love</i>.<p>

Even though the area we were privied to was incredibly huge, over two-thirds of the entire cavern is walled off, so we only saw a small part.  There are over three hundred columns in the cistern.  It was a sight to be seen.  Two feet of water covers the floor and fat carp and goldfish swim the waters, eating food dropped in by the passersby.  Even though the cistern was never meant to be viewed by people, the columns were made with marble and carved as if a king would live by them every day.  It is interesting to know that even though some columns were carved especially for the cistern, other pieces were taken from anywhere they could be found.  This was obvious when columns were square and suddenly rounded in another stone, or with the <i>medusa head</i> base seen to the right.  This head was obviously from some other temple or palace, but was the right shape to hold up a column so it became the new stone base.  And yes, it was placed in upside down!  There are two medusa heads, the second that is not pictured can be viewed <a class=popup href="javascript:pop('medusa2')">by clicking here</a>.<p>

After leaving the cistern, people browsed its gift shop for a while and eventually returned to the hotel to rest before dinner, which this time was not at the hotel's restaurant.  We instead ate at a place called the Sultan's Pub.  We were seated on an entirely separate floor from the rest of the restaurant's patrons, so it was quiet.  The food, when it finally arrived, was good but a bit lacking in portion.  After dinner we returned to the hotel and retired for the night.<p>

<a name="day three"><img src="gfx/day-3.jpg" border=0></a><br>

The final day we spent in Istanbul was to be a bit more of a laid back day.  The children and myself were permitted to stay in the hotel room and rest until lunch time, while the adults went to the Spice Bazaar and other shopping locations.  Everyone had a good time and sure enough the adults arrived at the hotel at approximately noon to go to lunch.<p>

Since its food was so good yesterday, we again went to the Pudding Shop for lunch.  As at the Sultan's Pub, we got second floor seats this time around.  No one was up there either except us, which once again allowed for good conversation.<p>

After the Pudding Shop, we headed to our last stop before boarding the cruise ship, the Topkapi Palace.  The Topkapi Palace was the official royal residence of the Ottoman sultans and the women of the harem for four hundred years.  The palace was built in the mid 1400's and abandoned in 1853 in favor of the Dolmabahce Palace located further up the Bosphorus.<p>

During our visit, the Topkapi Palace was guarded by a lot of men carrying sub-machine guns, and certain party members were afraid of being shot.  Mother figures cautioned not to make gestures or sounds in any way related to firearms (for the thought of us being terrorists) and then we entered.  We walked through a large garden to reach the door to enter the Harem, and would be let in shortly.<p>

Her voice was monotone and was near to impossible to distiguish the English from Turkish.  We also came to realize she was reciting the exact words from memory, with no personal insight or answering of questions.  These facts prevented me from learning anything much about the Harem, however these pictures give a good idea of what we saw.  (To view an additional picture of a green tiled wall, <a class=popup href="javascript:pop('palacegreenwall')">click here</a>.)

After enough idle wandering, everyone decided to visit the Sultan's Treasury, which stored all the valuable gold and precious stone-laiden objects.  We saw diamonds, including the famous Topkapi Diamond, emeralds, jade, ivory and other gems, gold thrones and all sorts of rings.  The dagger to the left is one of the many weapons on display that had been adorned in gold and precious stones.  It was interesting to note that these rooms were filled with security cameras, what appeared to be laser eyes, yet only one unarmed guard.<p>

When we had our fill of priceless Turkish treasures, our group once again began to leisurely walk about the massive palace grounds.  After going up and down a few sets of stairs, we came to a secluded courtyard that looked out to the ocean.  Our cruise ship, the Pacific Princess was visible from here.<p>

It was approaching nightfall and the time to go to the cruise ship was upon us.  We walked back from the palace to our hotel, collected our bags and got in several taxis to take us to the docks.  The taxi drivers were extremely aggressive on the road and weren't afraid to go toe-to-toe with a massive bus.  Amazingly we survived the taxi ride and stood waiting outside the ship check-in building.  Eagerly we filled in the neccessary forms and security items, took our 'Bon Voyage' photo and boarded the ship!<p>

<i>The boarding of the Pacific Princess concludes our synopsis of the Istanbul weekend.  The big momma now rears its head, the twelve-day cruise.  But before we look at what went on during the cruise, we'll take a brief look at the Turkish Lira and find out what people's reactions were to Istanbul.</i><p>
