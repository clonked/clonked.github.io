<i>And thus begins the logging of the twelve-day Holy Land cruise.  Please note due to the extremely long length of this portion of the trip we have been forced to divide the brief into several pages.  This in no way will affect your viewing pleasure however.</i><p>

Day one of the cruise is technically a half day due to the fact that we arrived at the ship at approxiately five p.m. on Monday, after visiting the Topkapi Palace in Istanbul.  With that in mind, it is important to note that nothing much was done except settling in to what would be our home for the next twelve days.<p>

After being dropped off at the Princess Cruise's check-in point by our reckless taxi drivers, we started through the process required to board the ship.  We put our luggage through the x-ray machines and it was then carried off to be delivered to our rooms later that night.  Heading up to the check-in desk we registered as being there and handed over our passports.  We were then given our room keys and 'charge cards.'  The Princess people then directed us to an area in which we had a group photo taken and we then boarded the Pacific Princess!<p>

We traveled two decks up to the Aloha Deck, which is where all our party's staterooms are located.  Everyone took the time to settle in to their staterooms and waited around for their luggage to be delivered.  After the delivery, the group broke off into smaller ones; some stayed in their rooms, others explored the ship.  But at eight fifteen everyone was in the same place, the Coral Dining Room for dinner.<p>

Since many people didn't even have their bags at dinner time, the meal was casual dress.  We were seated at a temporary table in a far, quiet corner.  The location was ideal, but the waiter was evil spawn of the devil.  He would smirk at your food choices, rush you into ordering and in general make you feel intimidated to be yourself at the table.  Fortunately we only had him for<br>one night. <p>

After dinner everyone retired to their staterooms to get a good night's rest for the tour in Istanbul tommorrow.<p>

Our party met for breakfast at the <i>Sun</i> Deck buffet at about eight a.m. because our tour of the Sultan's Summer Palace would be leaving in an hour.  The buffet was stocked with fresh fruits, breakfast meats and hash with a place that would fix eggs the way you like them.  After breakfast we headed down to the Carousel Lounge, the meeting place for most shore excursions.<p>

We gathered in the Carousel Lounge and were shortly thereafter given instructions on which group we were in and then proceeded to our bus which would take us to the Beylerbeyi Palace, once a summer residence to sultans.  We had to travel over the suspension bridge seen to the left, which is of Japanese construction and connects the European and Asian parts of Istanbul.  The summer palace was just over the bridge and to the left.  In fact the gardens actually have the cement supports for the bridge running into the ground next to the gardens.<p>

We unloaded from the bus and walked down a slopping path to a long stone tunnel which led into the gardens in front of the palace.  Upon entering the palace however we found that flash photography was prohibited, so we have no pictures of the interior.  We did have to put plastic baggies over our feet to enter as well.  There was a lot of marble used in the construction of the palace, which was built in 1865, and the Sultan who built it was extremely fond of boats and naval scenes, so many paintings on the walls and ceilings depicted this.  The palace was also built right along the Bosphorus Strait, and many rooms have quite picturesque views of it.  After the tour of the interior, we exited the building and walked about the gardens and the marble walkway that ran along the Bosphorus.  We then returned to the ship.<p>

The rest of the day was spent lounging around the ship.  At six o'clock the Pacific Princess shoved off from port.  We were out on deck for one last look as we left Istanbul.  The shoreline was quite impressive with the sunlight glistening off the domes and minarets of this truly unique metropolis with its mix of religions and cultures.<p>

Shortly after that our group began the process of preparing for formal night.  Nothing short of a suit and tie is acceptable on a man, and if not clothed properly, you may not be admitted into the dining room.  After the entire group was all snazzed up, we headed for the Starlight Lounge which became our regular meeting place for cocktail hour.  A few rounds of drinks later it was time for group photos, so we headed for the Grand Staircase.  We had our photos taken and then went to the dining room. Everyone enjoyed the excellent multi-course meal (details of which you'll learn about on the next page).  Some of the group decided to attend the movie that was playing in the ship's theater that night, <i>An Ideal Husband</i>, while others chose to retire to their staterooms.<p>

<i>If you thought these two days of the cruise sounded fun, then something is seriously wrong with you.  The best is yet to come people!  But before we continue following the cruise's progress, we're going to stop and look at the wide variety of foods served nightly in the Coral Dining Room.</i><p>
