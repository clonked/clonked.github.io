<i>Fortunately Nathan was present for this day in Israel so nothing has to be taken for chance.  And what a day it was going to be.  People were very excited to travel to Jerusalem and see things like the Garden of Gethsemane and the "Way of the Cross" and Bethlehem to see the Church of the Nativity where Jesus was born.</i><p>

It was another early tour, earlier than usual.  In fact, we had to set out at eight a.m.  Breakfast was the usual on the Sun Deck and everyone got on the bus ok.  We had quite a distance to ride to

reach our main destinations, Jerusalem and Bethlehem, but fortunately there was a tank museum on the way which we were going to stop at.  The 'museum' was actually a large gravel field with a bunch of Israeli retired tanks parked there, and signs offering interesting facts on them.  It was the highlight of the day for some, as posing in front of and on the tanks filled one with vigor.  We left this location all too soon so we could continue on.<p>

Jerusalem is a 5,000-year-old walled city considered sacred to more than a third of the people on Earth.  For Jews, it is the root of their devotion and the center of their national identity.  For Christians, the city where Jesus died and was resurrected stands as the very ideal of eternal life.  And for Muslims, Jerusalem is the third holiest city, behind Mecca and Medina, for it was from here that Mohammed ascended into heaven.  Whatever your beliefs, you cannot help but be awed by this mystical place.<p>

Our first stop in Jerusalem was Mount Scopus which provided an excellent view of the city and the next location we were going to visit, the Garden of Gethsemane and the Church of All Nations.  We piled back in the bus and made our way to them.

The church is oriented in a way so that it is to the right of the garden and can only be entered by going through the garden.  We walked through, and all around us were centuries-old olive trees and plants, looking beautiful.

The interior of the church was poorly lit except for the area immediately around the rock where Jesus knelt and prayed to God regarding his being sacrificed for the good of humanity before he was arrested.  <a class=popup href="javascript:pop('scripture')">Click here to read the scripture associated with this rock.</a>  We were there for only a short time when we had to head back to the bus and continue on to Bethlehem to the Church of the Nativity, the site of <br>Jesus' birth.<p>

Our buses parked in a garage downhill of the church, so we hiked uphill a bit, through street vendors all the way.  When we finally came to the temple, the door we had to enter through came maybe only a bit higher than our waists.  It was built like this to make enemy attacks difficult.  Once we were inside however, the place was huge!  Making our way through the crowds in the sanctuary, we headed down into a lower chamber, which is where Jesus was born.   It is actually a cave, not a stable or manger.  That is a common misconception in our display of the event of Jesus' birth.  Following our visiting to the Church of the Nativity, we went to a large trinket shop that sold things like holy water from the Jordan River, olive oil from old Bethlehem olive trees, holy soil from Bethlehem and carvings from olive wood.  After lining the owners pockets, we set off for lunch.<p>

After lunch we went to an area of Jerusalem where the Western Wall or Wailing Wall and the Via Dolorosa or "Way of the Cross" are situated.  The Western Wall is the most sacred of Jewish sites and is all that remains of the retaining wall that once supported the Temple Mount.  The Temple Mount is identified as Mount Moriah, the place where Abraham came to sacrifice his son to God.  This openness to God is revered in the Jewish, Christian and Muslim faiths and each consider this place to be holy ground.  For the Jewish people, the stones of the Western Wall have grown into an important symbol of the Jewish hopes for a restored nation.  For Christians, it was in this area that Jesus was put on trial before Pontius Pilate.  His sentence was carried out just outside the wall.  According to Islamic tradition, Mohammed ascended to heaven on his horse by leaping from the same rocky peak of the Temple Mount.  Thus, Jerusalem is indeed a pivotal city in the world's three great monotheistic religions.<p>

After people were done observing or praying at the wall, we continued on to the Way of the Cross, which is the path Jesus carried his cross along on his last day on earth 2000 years ago.  The route twists and turns through the old city along narrow and very crowded cobblestone streets.  There are fourteen stations on the route, ending in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre at the tomb where Jesus' body was placed.<p>

Following the Way of the Cross ended at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, the traditional site of Jesus' crucifixion, burial and resurrection.  Within this church and holy place are the Chapel of the Cross, marking Calvary, where Jesus was crucified and the nearby marble stone where Jesus' body rested and was prepared for burial.  This tomb is the holiest place in Christendom.  Over the years the stone has grown very shiny because of the oils from peoples hands that they rub into it.<p>

We left the church and continued our walk to meet the buses.  It was time to go home.  On the way there we saw the Israeli Armed Forces.  Their automatic rifles and shotguns made us feel real comfortable, and many of us wished that the military would march our streets in the USA.  Further down the walk we saw posters for the Chihuly exhibition at the Tower of David, but we didn't get to see it.<p>

When the buses returned us to the boat, is wasn't long before we had to eat.  It was a semiformal night, and cocktail hour started a bit late because of both us returning late and having to get cleaned up.  At dinner though, there was a little surprise in store for Kerree and Shelley.  Since their birthdays are in the same roundabout region, we had the kitchen staff make a cake so we could share a birthday celebration with them.  Out came the chefs singing and carrying the chocolate cake with pride.  Everyone ate lots of the cake, and went to bed very happy.<p>

<i>Man, Ashdod certainly was a busy day, and a mini pilgrimage for many.  Seeing and touching things that Jesus Christ himself once did has an awe-inspiring effect.  You can remain in the awe and hop forward to the two days in Egypt or backflip into Haifa.</i><p>
