<i>Sadly, Nathan was sick the day the Family Federation toured Haifa, so Heidi has agreed to take on the duty of reporting the activities of the day, though her abilities pale in comparison to our most senior webmaster.</i><p><br>

Roughly speaking, everything to the north and east of the port city of Haifa is known as "Galilee" - Israel's most lush region and the setting for much of the New Testament gospels.  Galilee is where Jesus lived, was baptized, preached and performed many micracles.<p>

It's interesting to note that the country of Israel is about the size of New Jersey with a population less than that of New York City.  But don't let its size fool you.  For it is a country with extraordinary religious, cultural and social diversity, only a bit of which I now have a better understanding.  Water is a rare commodity in Israel - its only sources being the Sea of Galilee and the Jordan River which flows into the Dead Sea, over one thousand feet below sea level.<p>

Our day started early - breakfast at 7:30 a.m. - since we had an 8 a.m. departure for Galilee and Nazareth.  Our travels would take us crosscountry from the coast of Israel to the eastern border for our visit to the Jordan River and the area around the Sea of Galilee.  We passed through the coastal Carmel Mountains into the Jezreel Valley.  This area is now a successful agricultural plain.  Once a barren land, the efforts of Jewish immigrants have turned it into a flourishing garden.  Mount Tabor rises from the Jezreel plain and it was at this location that the Transfiguration of Jesus took place.  Jesus revealed himself to Peter, James and John in order to strengthen them.  And a voice from above said, <blockquote><i>This is my beloved son of whom I am pleased: hear him. (Mark 9)</i></blockquote><p>

From there we traveled to our first stop, the Jordan River.  It was in a setting such as this that John baptized Jesus in the early days of his ministry.<p>


<blockquote><i>Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him...and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him,<br>and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him.  (Matthew 3)</i></blockquote><p>

From the Jordan River we traveled on along the Sea of Galilee through the Jewish town of Tiberias on our way to Tabgha.<p>

The Sea of Galilee was quite beautiful.  It is surprisingly small, more like that of a lake.  Behind the far shore rose the Golan Heights.  This was very picturesque.  Seeing the waters Jesus calmed with the rolling hills as a backdrop was a very peaceful moment.<p>

<blockquote><i>And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship,so that it was now full...And they awoke him, and he arose and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still.  And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.  (Mark 4)</i></blockquote>

To the north of the Sea of Galilee is the wine-producing area of the Golan Heights.  Here, the best wine in the country is produced.  The industry started in the early 1980's and is very modern.  Their equipment, methods and vines come from California, producing pleasant, light and fruity wines.  Of course, the wines are strictly kosher.  The property belongs to a cooperative of eight kibbutzim.<p>

Tabgha lies on the shore of the Sea of Galilee and it is here that the Church of the Multiplication of the Loaves and Fishes is located.  This is the site where Jesus performed his famous miracle.  Build on the ruins of a 4th-century Byzantine basilica, its mosaic floor commemorates that event.<p><blockquote><i>And Jesus went forth, and saw a great multitude.  And he commanded the multitude to sit...and took the five loaves, and the two fishes, and...blessed...and they did all eat and were filled.  And they that had eaten were about five thousand men, beside women and children.  (Matthew 14)</i></blockquote><p>

From Tabgha we traveled on to Capernaum, a site where Jesus preached and also the home of Simon-Peter.  Capernaum was a prosperous town during Jesus' ministry in Galilee.  The house of Saint Peter, in which Jesus lived for a time, is now covered by a church which still shows the house's 1st-century ruins.  Simon was renamed Peter by Jesus in order to indicate the apostle's rank in the new Christian church.<p>

On the site where Jesus preached are now the ruins of a synagogue, Franciscan monastery and other excavations.<p>

<blockquote><i>And there was a certain nobleman whose son was sick at Capernaum...The nobleman said unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.  Jesus said unto him, Go unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth.  (John 4)</i></blockquote><p>

<p>
From there we traveled up the hill to the Mount of the Beatitudes.  This high hill is the famous site where Jesus preached his Sermon on the Mount.  On the site is a domed Roman Catholic church, octagonal in shape, surrounded by a terrace and gardens overlooking the Sea of Galilee.<p><br>

<blockquote><i>Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.<br>
Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted.<br>
Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.<br>
Blessed are they who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be satisfied.<br>
Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy.<br>
Blessed are the clean of heart, for they will see God.<br>
Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.<br>
Blessed are they who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.<br>
Blessed are you when they insult you and persecute you and utter every kind of evil against you falsely because of me.  Rejoice and be glad, for your reward will be great in heaven.  (Matthew 5)</i></blockquote>

All of this packed into our morning and lunchtime was upon us.  We set out on our way to a most interesting experience for lunch - eating at a kibbutz.  We were fed a very nice meal then went on to learn the philosphy behind this rural, communal type of living.<p>

The kibbutz was founded on the belief that a return to the soil and the honesty of manual work were the ingredients for creating a new spirit in man.  Kibbutz life is based on the principle of collective production and consumption, the pooling of income, the subservience of individual desires and the equality of its members; everyone working for the good of the whole.  The kibbutz is an entirely self-contained, self-suffienct community.  Children are educated here, physicians live and work here and all worship together.<p>

Our final stop of the day was where Jesus grew up, the town of Nazareth.  Once a tiny village, which is not mentioned in the Old Testament, Nazareth has grown into a large town that figures prominently in the Christian religion.  This is evident in its over 40 churches, monasteries and other religious buildings.  Our visit was to the Church of the Annunciation.  The church is built over the site of the original grotto where the Archangel Gabriel appeared before Mary announcing the forthcoming birth of her son, Jesus.  This can be seen on the lower level.<br>

<blockquote><i>And the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth, To a virgin...And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favor with God.  And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS. (Luke 1)</i></blockquote><p>

Above the grotto is a modern-style church which is quite impressive.  The sanctuary walls are covered with murals created by countries from around the world all with the theme of "Madonna and Child".  These are quite beautiful and very different from one another.  It was interesting to see each country's depiction of Jesus and his mother.<p>

Jesus grew up in the tranquility of Nazareth, raised in the Jewish tradition and with respect for the Scriptures.  He later returned to the town of his childhood to unveil his mission.  An interesting sidenote about Nazareth is that today it is home to the largest Arab community in the State of Israel.<p>

<br>
<i>This wraps up Heidi's reporting of the day in Nazareth and Galilee, port stop Haifa.  At this time, I would like to personally acknowledge Nathan for the tremendous job he has done in creating this wonderful webpage of our trip.  His efforts are much appreciated.  Just writing one day's worth for me has been more than enough!  Thanks, Nate, for the memories!!<br>You may continue forward to Ashdod, the day in Israel where Nathan rejoins us and is back in the webmaster's chair or, if you choose, you can go back and re-read the sea day.</i><p>
